# Diabetes_Prediction

## Overview
This project is designed to predict diabetes using various machine learning algorithms. The goal is to create a model that can accurately classify whether a patient has diabetes based on certain medical attributes.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Model training and evaluation
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model deployment

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/untitled2-checkpoint.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd Diabetes_Prediction
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Run the data preprocessing script:
    ```sh
    python preprocess.py
    ```
2. Train the model:
    ```sh
    python train.py
    ```
3. Evaluate the model:
    ```sh
    python evaluate.py
    ```
